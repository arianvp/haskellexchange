# Building Single Page Applications in Elm

# Current state of web development
*  Lots of tools
* Lots of frameworks
* Transpilers, compatibility layers, package managers
* https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016
* Overall pretty messy

---
# What is Elm?
## At first
* An experimental language to explore Functional Reactive Programming
* Strong types
* Aimed at beginners

---
# What is Elm
## Now
* No FRP anymore, focusses on _The Elm Architecture_
* Easy way to build interactive web apps
* Similar to Facebook React + Redux
* Actualy, redux is a port of _The Elm Architecture_ to JavasScript
* A powerhorse
* Still beginner friendly
---

# Why Elm
.pull-left[
* JavaScript and its ecosystem is pretty scary these days (https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.nju4zrbov)
* I like types
* I like functional style
* Great error messages

The argument for `getFullName` is causing a
mismatch.
21| getFullName
22|>  {
23|>    firstName = "Arian",
24|>    lastName = "van Putten",
25|>    hairColor = "ginger",
26|>  }

Function `getFullName` is expexting argument
to be:
    
    { ..., phoenNumber : ... }

But it is:
    { ..., phoneNumber : ... }

Hint: I compared the record fields and found som
potential typos.
  phoenNumber <-> phoneNumber
```

1. `view` can attach event handlers to DOM elements
2. Those generate events of type `Msg`
3. `update` gets called with `Msg` to decrement or increment counter
4. `view` gets called to render counter.

# Composing Components
```elm
Html.App.map : (submsg -> msg) -> Html submsg -> Html msg
```
* given a way to turn `submsg` into `msg` .
* Will modify all event handlers to emit `msg` instead of `submsg`
* This is the functor instance of Html! (If elm had typeclasses)

# What I miss in Elm

* No Functor, Monad, Applicative . No typelcasses at all!
* Means I can't  genenarlise patterns like `Task.andThen` and `Html.App.map`
* This stuff is scary for beginners. But makes advanced users productive
* I advice looking at PureScript .  Does have typeclasses
